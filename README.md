## About the project
This project is a step-by-step learning experience in building dashboard projects using Tableau which I replicated from Data with Baraa Youtube channel. You can find the link of the youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y).

## About the dataset
The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.

## User Story - HR Dashboard
As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis

## Summary View
The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

## Overview
The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:  <br>
•	Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees. <br>
•	Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years. <br>
•	Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles. <br>
•	Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ) <br>
•	Show the distribution of employees by city and state. <br>

## Demographics
The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including: <br>
•	Present the gender ratio in the company. <br>
•	Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels. <br>
•	Show the total number of employees within each age group. <br>
•	Show the total number of employees within each education level. <br>
•	Present the correlation between employees’ educational backgrounds and their performance ratings. <br>

## Income
The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:<br>
•	Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns. <br>
•	Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department. <br>

## Employee Records View
•	Provide a comprehensive list of all employees with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary. <br>
•	Users should be able to filter the list based on any of the available columns.
